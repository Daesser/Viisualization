## Gestalt principles
**Proximity**: We perceive objects close to each other as belonging to a group.<br />
**Dashboard**: Place some visuals close together to encourages the users to think that the grouped visuals are in the same context.

**Similarity**: We seek similarities and differences in objects and link similar objects as belonging to a group.<br />
**Dashboard**: Apply link of visuals residing in separate locations on a dashboard by using same color (for sales) or shape. Encouraging comparisons of any 
data in various places.

**Closure**: Our minds tend to see complete figures or forms even if a picture is incomplete.<br />
**Dashboard**: When designing graphs only two axes (or none), rather than full enclosure, are required to define the space of the data. Avoid clutter.

**Enclosure**: We perceive objects as belonging to a group when they are enclosed in a way that creates a boundary or border around them.<br />
**Dashboard**: Enclose objects with a border or a boundary to get the audience to focus on a group of objects in a chart (alternative: Pre-attentive attributes).

**Connection**: We perceive objects connected to each other as a single group as opposed to objects that are not linked in the same manner.<br />
**Dashboard**: Especially useful for tying together non-quantitative data, e.g, represent relationships between steps in a process or employees relationships (hierachy).

**Continuity**: Our tendency is to see shapes as continuous to the greatest degree possible. The human eye follows lines, curves or a sequence of shapes to create pathways.<br />
**Dashboard**: Align things with one another which belong to the same group, e.g, hierarchical structure in matrix table for grouping.
